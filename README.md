# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Detection-using-ResNet50
This repository contains my project for CET313 – Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sunderland. The project applies deep learning for medical image classification, specifically detecting Alzheimer’s Disease from MRI scans using a pretrained ResNet50 model.
